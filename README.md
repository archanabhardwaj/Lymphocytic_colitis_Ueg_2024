# Description
This repository contains the main source code for the project titled "Lymphocytic colitis can be transcriptionally divided into channelopathic and inflammatory lymphocytic colitis." The project aims to explore the transcriptional patterns and classification of lymphocytic colitis into distinct subtypes based on gene expression profiles.

**Usage : 
**This repository serves as a resource for researchers interested in understanding the transcriptional divisions within lymphocytic colitis. The codebase can be used to replicate the analysis or extend the research.
