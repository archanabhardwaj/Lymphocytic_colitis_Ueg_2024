# Description
This repository contains the main source code for the project titled "Lymphocytic colitis can be transcriptionally divided into channelopathic and inflammatory lymphocytic colitis." The project aims to explore the transcriptional patterns and classification of lymphocytic colitis into distinct subtypes based on gene expression profiles.

# Overview

The analyses presented here provide insights into the molecular heterogeneity of lymphocytic colitis, highlighting differences between lymphocytic colitis subtypes. The codebase includes scripts and workflows used for preprocessing, differential expression analysis, and downstream classification.

# Usage : 
This repository serves as a resource for researchers interested in understanding the transcriptional divisions within lymphocytic colitis. The codebase can be used to replicate the analysis or extend the research.
